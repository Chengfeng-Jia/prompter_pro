Navigating restricted waterways is challenging due to limited space and unpredictable situations. **PROMPTER** is a motion planning framework that models navigation as an inference problem using a Bayesian factor graph. It incorporates ship maneuverability, situational awareness, and path planning, while accounting for obstacles, narrow channels, encounters, and regulations. PROMPTER supports both cooperative and non-cooperative strategies for scenarios with varying communication reliability.
